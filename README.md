# EvolutionOfCoffee

*How did coffee become the product as we know it today?*

Not sure yet if focus should be mainly on Arabica, or only. 

Visualisation for Programmeerproject

## Proposal

### General

My plan is to visualise the evolution of the product coffee, from the myth about Kaldi the Ethiopian goatherd to Howard Schultz introducing espresso at Starbucks in 1982, and from a single coffee market, introduced by the Dutch East Indian Company (VOC), to direct trade between roasteries and farms, together trying to optimize the flavour of a single origin coffee. This evolution can be divided in three waves, possibly fourth (in which the case the fourth wave has just started).I will be using maps to show which countries were significantly involved in every wave, and per country some important information will be available: influential companies and people that were involved, some statistics on that country around that time (e.g. total coffee export per year). Also possible some fun facts per country or wave, and the common methods that were used at that time. So I think I will also write a short story about every wave, explaining the main characteristics and differences compared to the previous wave. For the first wave, this storty will possibly be about Kaldi and his dancing goats.

### Interactivity

When starting the visualisation, the user will first see a black screen with the title "The Evolution of Coffee" and the subscript "From Kaldi to homeroasting". Below this will be the text, all centered, "Pick your wave". Below this, the user will have to possibility to click on one of the three/four waves. When they do so, a map will be appear on the screen. This will be below the rest of the visualisation, or will be a sort of pop-up screen, I'm not sure yet. 

When moving the mouse over the a specific country, this company will highlight/pop-up and information will become available. 

### Information (so far)

#### First wave (11th century - +/- 1950)

**The Story of Kaldi** Long, long ago, in the far-away Ethiopian highlands, there lived a goatherd. His name was Kaldi, and one day he noticed his dancing and being unable to sleep at night after eating the berries from a certain plant. Kaldi told the abbot at the local monastery about his findings, and the abbot and the other monks started exploring this unique berry and its effects. Although this story is just a myth and can not be confirmed, coffee does originate from Ethiopia. 

*when moving over the Arab Peninsula* After its discovery in Ethiopia, the Arabs were the first to cultivate and trade coffee. This was around 14th century, and for next couple of hundred years, the Arabs held a monopoly on coffeetrade. In the 15th century it was mainly grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia, but by the 16th century coffee was being drunk in Persia, Turkey, Egypt and Syria. This also led to the creation of the first coffee houses, of which the first one was reported to be located at Constantinopel in 1475, and was called 'Kiva Han'.

*when moving over the Netherlands* Because the Arabs only sold roasted beans, the Netherlands, among other European countries, were not able to cultivate coffee themselves. This monopoly came to an end when a trader from the Dutch East Indian Company, Pieter van der Broecke, managed to 'obtain' (some sources say 'steal') some coffee plants from Yemen in 1616. These plants grew so well in the Amsterdam Botanical Gardens, that in 1658 the first 'Coffea Arabica' was being cultivated in Ceylon(Sri Lanka) and not much later also in other Dutch colonies, such as India, Java (Indonesia) and Suriname. 

*when moving over France* Although the Dutch were the first to cultivate coffee outside of the Arabian Peninsula, the French were the ones who exported it to biggest coffee-producing country in the world, Brazil. Back in 1714, the Mayor of Amsterdam gave King Louise XIV of France a coffee plant, as a present to grow in the Paris Royal Botanical Gardens. Some of the seeds of this plant were taken by Gabriel de Clieu in 1723 and brought to Martinique, one of the French colonies at that time. Most of the coffee that is being grown in Middle and Southern America today originates from those seeds.

#### Second coffee wave (1950 - 1990)

**The Start of the Second wave** 

After the discovery of the coffee in Ethiopia and it being cultived all over the world, coffee was almost indispensable in the daily routine of many people around the world. The coffee houses were places were people met to talk about all sorts of things, from day-to-day stuff to important strategic decisions. And although there were differences, almost all coffee made using a filtering technique; the roasted beans were grinded and the coffee was extracted using hot water. Espresso started growing in popularity around the world from around 1950, thereby ushering the second wave of coffee. 

*when moving over Italy* 

An espresso was made with a different technique. A small amount of water was pushed through coffeegrounds. This technique was first patented by Angelo Moriono in Turin in 1884, and the espresso machine has been perfected ever after. Espresso was a very popular drink, not just because the drink itself, but also because the variations that came with it, such as the cappuccino, which is an espresso with foamed milk. This version was particulary popular outside of Italy itself, mainly in Gread Britain. In Italy, espresso was a beverage for the working-class, and the price of a single espresso, if you were standing at the bar while drinking it, was being regulated by the government, and thus keeping it very, very affordable.

*when moving over the US* 

Although espresso was already known in the United States, it wasn't a well known drink until the 1990's. From 1820 until then, coffee had been the most popular drink in the United States, but nobody had given much care to the production of it. As long as it had a lot of caffeine in it and kept you awake, it did not really matter how it tasted. There even was instant-coffee (not just in the United States, most coffee drinkers around the world did not care much for the flavour or origin of coffee). All of this changed when Howard Schultz came to Starbucks in 1982. Howard Schultz, inspired by the Italian espresso culture, introduced espresso and lots of different espresso-based drinks. The success this has brought Starbucks has been immense, quickly conquering the US and most of Western Europe. Starbucks also introduced something important; they were the first who started direct-trading with the farmers at a global scale. Instead of buying their coffee on world market for coffee, they started paying more for a certain variation of coffee, grown at a specific farm in a specific region of a specific country, and working together with the farmers to create, in their eyes, a perfect coffeebean. 

#### Third coffee wave 

Initialised by Starbucks around 1990, more and more companies started direct-trading with farmers to ensure the highest possible quality of the coffee and to find and create particular flavours. People started focussing on the origin of a coffee, how it was processed, what region it was from and what variety it was. Coffee was no longer only being traded on a single Coffea Arabica market for a single price; over 40 different varietes have already been discovered, and still new varietiens are discovered or created, all with their own unique charactaristics. With all this focus for detail about the bean and the processes that were involved, also came a new interest in extraction methods. Espresso, although still by far the most sold coffee in coffeehouses today, was not the only way to make coffee anymore. New techniques were discovered and old ones were being used again. The new focus on 'filter coffees' also let to new ways of roasting; where, in general, an espresso roast is pretty dark, in order bring out the sweetness and bitterness in coffee (the high pressure of an espresso machine increase the level of acidity in coffee, so this needs to be balanced out), a filter coffee roast could be lighter, fruitier and greener. Most filter methods do not use any form of pressure, thus leading to a calmer extraction, and very little distorted flavours.

*when moving over the US* Although Starbucks was, and still is, by far the biggest player in the specialty coffee, they did remain focussed on espresso-based coffees, especially the flavoured and frozen specials, instead of also joining the renewed interest in filter coffees. This left room for smaller business to fill this market, of which some by now have grown to chains themselves, such as Intelligentsia Coffee in Chicago and Blue Bottle Coffee in Oakland. Typical for the American coffee culture are the large pots or tanks of filtercoffee from which you can pull your own cup of coffee, and the usually very large sizes. Also, in 1982, the Specialty Coffee Association of America was founded, and they were the first to create a grading scheme to decide on whether a particular coffee was a 'specialty coffee'. 

*when moving over the Western Europe (NL, BE, DE, GB)* A very experimental coffee culture, similar to the Scandinavian culture. Some people use more Australian roasts, some use more Scandinavian roasts, although the main trend lies more towards the lighter, Nordic roasts. The coffee culture is in a very developed stadium here. Every (major) city has lots of coffeehouses, and there are different kind of places for different needs; from small roasteries with a unique single origin from Rwanda to large chains such as Starbucks. There is a huge focus on quality and consistency; there are places, mainly in London, where they weight every shot of espresso (in and out) that they make. 

*when moving over the Scandinavia(DK, SE, NO)* All of Scandinavia has been very active in the third coffee wave. Typical for the 'Scandinavian' or 'Nordic' roast is that it is in general a very light roast, were filtercoffee beans are barely being roasted after the 'the first crack'. This is the moment in the roasting process where the first gasses escape from beans, thereby causing them to, quite literally, crack. 

*when moving over the Australia* Australia is the country were they 'invented' the flat white; an espresso-based beverage, similar to latte, but with less milk, thus having a espresso-to-milk ratio somewhere between a latte and a cortado. Where the American coffee culture focuses on large amounts of coffee, the Australian coffee culture focusses on single, smaller cups of coffee, making one coffee at the time. In this way this culture is similar to the European culture, although the Australians tend to using darker roasts, especially compared to Scaninavia.

*when moving over the Japan* Although Japan's coffee culture has existed since a Dutch man brought it to Nagasaki in the 19th century, it did not really boom until the 1970's. Since then, it has grown explosively, with lots of coffeehouses being opened. Too of the biggest players in the filter coffee market, Hario and Kalita, originate from Japan. 

*statistics* coffee trade, brands (la marzocco, synesso, starbucks, peet's coffee). 

#### Fourth coffee wave

- Lots of individual roasteries with a small bar, distinguish yourself not only by what beans you buy and how you make your coffee, but also by roasting it yourself, thereby having even more control over the flavour of the coffee that is being served. Also, more championships are being created, such as the Aeropress World Championship. What is also new in this wave is the focus on making customers and other parties in the hospilaty industry use the individually roasted specialty coffees at home or in their cafe/bar/hotel/restaurant, not just drink them at the coffee bars. This involves not only selling the coffee, but also teaching about the different techniques used to create that particular coffee, but more important, what techniques are required to extract a proper cup of coffee. In the fourth wave, it is not just about creating the 'best' coffee; it is about exploring all the different flavours that are available, what different roasts do to different coffee beans, what extraction techniques result in what flavours, and sharing this knowledge with the rest of the world, not just with the coffee 'elite'.
