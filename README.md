# EvolutionOfCoffee

*How did coffee become the product as we know it today?*

Visualisation for Programmeerproject

## Proposal

### General

My plan is to visualise the evolution of the product coffee, from the myth about Kaldi the Ethiopian goatherd to Howard Schuldz introducing espresso at Starbucks in 1982, and from a single coffee market, introduced by the Dutch East Indian Company (VOC), to direct trade between roasteries and farms, together trying to optimize the flavour of a single origin coffee. This evolution can be divided in three waves, possibly fourth (in which the case the fourth wave has just started).I will be using maps to show which countries were significantly involved in every wave, and per country some important information will be available: influential companies and people that were involved, some statistics on that country around that time (e.g. total coffee export per year). Also possible some fun facts per country or wave, and the common methods that were used at that time. So I think I will also write a short story about every wave, explaining the main characteristics and differences compared to the previous wave. For the first wave, this storty will possibly be about Kaldi and his dancing goats.

### Interactivity

When starting the visualisation, the user will first see a black screen with the title "The Evolution of Coffee" and the subscript "From Kaldi to homeroasting". Below this will be the text, all centered, "Pick your wave". Below this, the user will have to possibility to click on one of the three/four waves. When they do so, a map will be appear on the screen. This will be below the rest of the visualisation, or will be a sort of pop-up screen, I'm not sure yet. 

When moving the mouse over the a specific country, this company will highlight/pop-up and information will become available.
