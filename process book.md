# The Report Document

## 06.01.2015

- Installed Git and created a GitHub account, created a .gitignore, README.md and LICENSE.md (with MIT-license).
- Started writing the proposal in the README.md.

## 06.02.2015

- Created a IMAGES directory, added the first sketch.
- Continued to work in README.md, finished the proposal. Started working on the content of the visualisation, so the texts that will appear when moving over countries.

## 06.03.2015

- Continued working on the text content in README.md.
- Created eoc.js, eoc.html, eoc_html.css and eoc_svg.css. 
- I'm still doubting on whether I will use bootstrap for the design of my visualisation, for now I will stick to svg and d3. The basic elements have been created, next step is to work out how to get the world maps where I want them, in a way that I can perform transformations and stuff like that. It is gonna be a lot of work. 

## 06.04.2015

Today: 
- I will be working on implementing the maps in the code. 
- I will try to use bootstrap after all, due to its design capabilities
- Decided to go for a sort light brown-ish colour scheme, will probably use colorbrewer2.org to acquire a proper colour scheme
