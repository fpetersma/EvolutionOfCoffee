<!--         <p id="wave-1-text">Long, long ago, in the far-away Ethiopian highlands, there lived a goatherd. His name was Kaldi, and one day he noticed his dancing and being unable to sleep at night after eating the berries from a certain plant. Kaldi told the abbot at the local monastery about his findings, and the abbot and the other monks started exploring this unique berry and its effects. Although this story is just a myth and can not be confirmed, coffee does originate from Ethiopia. </p>
        <p id="wave-2-text">After the discovery of the coffee in Ethiopia and it being cultived all over the world, coffee was almost indispensable in the daily routine of many people around the world. The coffee houses were places were people met to talk about all sorts of things, from day-to-day stuff to important strategic decisions. And although there were differences, almost all coffee made using a filtering technique; the roasted beans were grinded and the coffee was extracted using hot water. Espresso started growing in popularity around the world from around 1950, thereby ushering the second wave of coffee. </p>
        <p id="wave-3-text">Initialised by Starbucks around 1990, more and more companies started direct-trading with farmers to ensure the highest possible quality of the coffee and to find and create particular flavours. People started focussing on the origin of a coffee, how it was processed, what region it was from and what variety it was. Coffee was no longer only being traded on a single Coffea Arabica market for a single price; over 40 different varietes have already been discovered, and still new varietiens are discovered or created, all with their own unique charactaristics. With all this focus for detail about the bean and the processes that were involved, also came a new interest in extraction methods. Espresso, although still by far the most sold coffee in coffeehouses today, was not the only way to make coffee anymore. New techniques were discovered and old ones were being used again. The new focus on 'filter coffees' also let to new ways of roasting; where, in general, an espresso roast is pretty dark, in order bring out the sweetness and bitterness in coffee (the high pressure of an espresso machine increase the level of acidity in coffee, so this needs to be balanced out), a filter coffee roast could be lighter, fruitier and greener. Most filter methods do not use any form of pressure, thus leading to a calmer extraction, and very little distorted flavours. </p>
